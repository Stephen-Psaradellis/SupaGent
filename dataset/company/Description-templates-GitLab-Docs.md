Description templates:
Create consistent layouts for issues and merge requests across projects.

Support custom templates for projects, groups, and the entire instance.
Auto-populate fields with variables and quick actions.
Ensure proper tracking of bugs, features, and other work items.

You can define templates to use as descriptions
for your:
Issues

)
Tasks
Objectives and key results
Incidents
Service Desk tickets
Merge requests
Projects inherit templates from their group and instance.
Templates must be:
Saved with the
.md
extension.
Stored in your project’s repository in the
.gitlab/issue_templates
or
.gitlab/merge_request_templates
directory.
Present on the default branch.
Create a description template
Create a new description template as a Markdown (
.md
) file inside the
.gitlab/issue_templates/
directory in your repository.
To create a work item description template:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Code
>
Repository
.
Next to the default branch, select
plus
.
Select
New file
.
Next to the default branch, in the
File name
text box, enter
.gitlab/issue_templates/mytemplate.md
,
where
mytemplate
is the name of your template.
Commit to your default branch.
To check if this has worked correctly:
Create a new issue
or
create a new epic
.
See if you can find your description template in the
Choose a template
dropdown list.
Create a merge request template
Similarly to issue templates, create a new Markdown (
.md
) file inside the
.gitlab/merge_request_templates/
directory in your repository.
Unlike issue templates, merge requests have additional inheritance rules that depend on the contents
of commit messages and branch names.
For more information, see
creating merge requests
.
To create a merge request description template for a project:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Code

Repository
.
Next to the default branch, select
plus
.
Select
New file
.
Next to the default branch, in the
File name
text box, enter
.gitlab/merge_request_templates/mytemplate.md
,
where
mytemplate
is the name of your merge request template.
Commit to your default branch.
To check if this has worked correctly,
create a new merge request
and see if you can find your description template in the
Choose a template
dropdown list.
Use the templates
When you create or edit an issue or a merge request, it shows in the
Choose a template
dropdown list.
To apply a template:
Create or edit an issue, work item, or a merge request.
Select the
Choose a template
dropdown list.
If the
Description
text box hasn’t been empty, to confirm, select

.
When you select a description template, its content is copied to the description text box.
To discard any changes to the description you’ve made after selecting the template: expand the
Choose a template
dropdown list and select
Reset template
.
You can create shortcut links to create an issue using a designated template.
For example:
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20proposal
. Read more about
creating issues using a URL with prefilled values
.
Supported variables in merge request templates
History

the default template
.

your merge request template with their values:

Set instance-level description templates
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
You can set a description template at the
instance level
for issues
and merge requests by using an
instance template repository
.
You can also use the instance template repository for file templates.
You might also be interested in
project templates
that you can use when creating a new project in the instance.
Set group-level description templates
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
With
group-level
description templates, you can select a project within the group to store
your templates. Then, you can access these templates in other projects in the group.
As a result, you can use the same templates in issues and merge requests in all the group’s projects.
Prerequisites:
You must have the Owner role for the group.
The project must be a direct child of the group.
To re-use templates
you’ve created
:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your group. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
General
.
Expand
Templates
.
From the dropdown list, select your template project as the template repository at group level.
Select
Save changes
.
You might also be interested in templates for various
file types in groups
.
Set a default template for merge requests and issues
In a project, you can choose a default description template for new issues and merge requests.
As a result, every time a new merge request or issue is created, it’s pre-filled with the text you
entered in the template.
Prerequisites:
On your project’s left sidebar, select
Settings
>
General
and expand
Visibility, project features, permissions
.
Ensure issues or merge requests are set to either
Everyone with access
or
Only Project Members
.
To set a default description template for merge requests, either:
Create a merge request template
named
Default.md
(case-insensitive)
and save it in
.gitlab/merge_request_templates/
.
The
Default.md
template does not take priority over the default template set in project settings.
For more information, see
priority of default description templates
.
Users on GitLab Premium and Ultimate: set the default template in project settings:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Merge requests
.
In the
Default description template for merge requests
section, fill in the text area.
Select
Save changes
.
To set a default description template for issues, either:
Create an issue template
named
Default.md
(case-insensitive)
and save it in
.gitlab/issue_templates/
.
The
Default.md
template does not take priority over the default template set in project settings.
For more information, see
priority of default description templates
.
Users on GitLab Premium and Ultimate: set the default template in project settings:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
General
.
Expand
Default description template for issues
.
Fill in the text area.
Select
Save changes
.
Because GitLab merge request and issues support
Markdown
, you can use it to format
headings, lists, and so on.
You can also provide
issues_template
and
merge_requests_template
attributes in the
Projects REST API
to keep your default issue and merge request templates up to date.
Priority of default description templates
When you set
issue description templates
in various places, they have the following priorities in a project.
The ones higher up override the ones below:
Template set in project settings.
Default.md
(case-insensitive) from the parent group.
Default.md
(case-insensitive) from the project repository.
Merge requests have
additional inheritance rules
that depend on the contents of commit messages and branch names.
Example description template
We use description templates for issues and merge requests in the
.gitlab
folder
of the
GitLab project, which you can refer to for some examples.
It’s possible to use
quick actions
in description templates to quickly add
labels, assignees, and milestones. The quick actions are only executed if the user submitting
the issue or merge request has the permissions to perform the relevant actions.
Here is an example of a bug report template:
## Summary
<!-- HTML comments are not displayed -->
(Summarize the bug encountered concisely)
## Steps to reproduce
(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)
## Example Project
(If possible, create an example project here on GitLab.com that exhibits the problematic
behavior, and link to it here in the bug report.
If you are using an older version of GitLab, this will also determine whether the bug has been fixed
in a more recent version)
## What is the current bug behavior?
(What actually happens)
## What is the expected correct behavior?
(What you should see instead)
## Relevant logs and/or screenshots
(Paste any relevant logs - use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code, as
it's very hard to read otherwise.)
## Possible fixes
(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)
