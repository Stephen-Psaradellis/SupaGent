Get started with GitLab Duo
GitLab Duo is your AI-native assistant. It can help you write, review, and edit code,
along with a variety of other tasks throughout your GitLab workflow.
It can help you troubleshoot your pipeline, write tests, address vulnerabilities, and more.
Step 1: Ensure you have access to GitLab Duo
To get started with GitLab Duo, your organization must have a Premium or Ultimate subscription
and a GitLab Duo add-on.
Your add-on determines the GitLab Duo features you have access to.
The GitLab Duo Core add-on comes with all Premium and Ultimate subscriptions.
The GitLab Duo Pro and GitLab Duo Enterprise add-ons are available for purchase.
For GitLab Duo features, your organization can use the GitLab default language models
or host their own models by using GitLab Duo Self-Hosted.
If you have issues accessing GitLab Duo features, your administrators
can check the health of the installation.

Step 2: Try GitLab Duo Chat in the UI
Now, try using Chat in the GitLab UI.
Go to a project and in the upper-right corner, a button named
GitLab Duo Chat
should be displayed.
If this button is available, it means everything is configured properly.
Try asking Chat a question or type

Step 3: Try other GitLab Duo features
GitLab Duo is available in all stages of your workflow. From troubleshooting
CI/CD pipelines to writing test cases and resolving security threats, GitLab Duo can help you
in a variety of ways.
The features you have access to differ depending on your subscription tier, add-on, and offering.
For example, if you have access to:
