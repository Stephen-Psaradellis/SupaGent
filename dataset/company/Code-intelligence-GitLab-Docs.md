Code intelligence adds code navigation features common to interactive
development environments (IDE), including:
Type signatures and symbol documentation.
Go-to definition.
Code intelligence is built into GitLab and powered by
LSIF
(Language Server Index Format), a file format for precomputed code
intelligence data. GitLab processes one LSIF file per project, and
Code intelligence does not support different LSIF files per branch.
SCIP
is the next evolution of tooling
for indexing source code. You can use it to power code navigation features,
such as:
Go to definition
Find references
GitLab does not natively support SCIP for code intelligence. However, you can use the
SCIP CLI
to convert
indexes generated with SCIP tooling into a LSIF-compatible file. For discussions on native
SCIP support, see
issue 412981
.
For progress on upcoming code intelligence enhancements, see
epic 4212
.
Configure code intelligence
Prerequisites:
You’ve checked to ensure there is a compatible indexer for your project’s languages:
LSIF indexers
SCIP indexers
To see how your language is best supported, review the
indexers recommended by Sourcegraph
.
With the CI/CD component
History
Python support
introduced
in GitLab 17.9.
.Net/C# support
introduced
in GitLab 18.0.
GitLab provides a
CI/CD component
to configure code intelligence
in your
.gitlab-ci.yml
file. The component supports these languages:
Go version 1.21 or later.
TypeScript or JavaScript.
Java 8, 11, 17, and 21.
Python
.Net/C#
To contribute more languages to the component, open a merge request in the
Code intelligence component project
.
Add a GitLab CI/CD component to your project’s
.gitlab-ci.yml
. For example, this job generates
the LSIF artifact for
golang
:
include
:
-
component
:
${CI_SERVER_FQDN}/components/code-intelligence/golang-code-intel@v0.0.3
inputs
:
golang_version
:
${GO_VERSION}
For configuration instructions for the
code intelligence component
,
check the
README
for each supported language.
For more configuration details, see
Use a component
.
Add CI/CD jobs for code intelligence
To enable code intelligence for a project, add GitLab CI/CD jobs to your project’s
.gitlab-ci.yml
.
With a SCIP indexer
Add a job to your
.gitlab-ci.yml
configuration. This job generates the
SCIP index and converts it to LSIF for use in GitLab:
"code_navigation"
:
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
# the job only needs to run against the default branch
image
:
node:latest
stage
:
test
allow_failure
:
true
# recommended
script
:
-
npm install -g @sourcegraph/scip-typescript
-
npm install
-
scip-typescript index
-
|
env \
TAG="v0.4.0" \
OS="$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')" \
ARCH="$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/')" \
bash -c 'curl --location "https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip/releases/download/$TAG/scip-$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz"' \
| tar xzf - scip
-
chmod +x scip
-
./scip convert --from index.scip --to dump.lsif
artifacts
:
reports
:
lsif
:
dump.lsif
Depending on your CI/CD configuration, you might need to run the job manually,
or wait for it to run as part of an existing pipeline.
With a LSIF indexer
Add a job (
code_navigation
) to your
.gitlab-ci.yml
configuration to generate the index:
code_navigation
:
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
# the job only needs to run against the default branch
image
:
sourcegraph/lsif-go:v1
allow_failure
:
true
# recommended
script
:
-
lsif-go
artifacts
:
reports
:
lsif
:
dump.lsif
Depending on your CI/CD configuration, you might need to run the job manually,
or wait for it to run as part of an existing pipeline.
GitLab limits the artifact produced by the code generation jobs to 200 MB by the
(
ci_max_artifact_size_lsif
)
artifact application limit. On GitLab Self-Managed instances, an instance administrator
can change this value.
View code intelligence results
After the job succeeds, browse your repository to see code intelligence information:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Code
>
Repository
.
Go to the file in your repository. If you know the filename, either:
Enter the
/~
keyboard shortcut to open the file finder, and enter the file’s name.
In the upper right, select
Find file
.
Point to lines of code. Items on that line with information from code intelligence display a dotted line underneath them:
Select the item to learn more information about it.
Find references
Use code intelligence to see all uses of an object:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Code
>
Repository
.
Go to the file in your repository. If you know the filename, either:
Enter the
/~
keyboard shortcut to open the file finder, and enter the file’s name.
In the upper right, select
Find file
.
Point to the object, then select it.
In the dialog, select:
Definition
to see a definition of this object.
References
to view a list of the files that use this object.
