Your
repository
is a component
of your GitLab project. You store your code in your repository, and track changes to it with version
control.
Each repository is part of a
GitLab project
, and cannot exist without a GitLab project.
Your project provides the configuration options for your repository.
Create a repository
To create a repository:
Create a project
or
Fork an existing project
.
Add files to a repository
You can add files to a repository:
When you
create a project
, or
After you create a project, using the following options:
Web editor
.
User Interface (UI)
.
Command line
.
Add a file from the UI
To add or upload a file from the GitLab UI:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Go to the directory you want to upload the file to.
Next to the directory name, select the plus icon (
plus
) >
Upload file
.
Drop or upload your file.
Enter a commit message.
Optional. To create a merge request with your changes, in
Target branch
, enter a branch name
that’s not your repository’s
default branch
.
Select
Upload file
.
Commit changes to a repository
You can commit your changes to a branch in the repository. When you use the command line,
use
git commit
.
For information about how to use commits to improve communication and collaboration,
trigger or skip pipelines, and reverting changes, see
commits
.
Clone a repository
You can clone a repository using the:
Command line:
Clone with SSH
Clone with HTTPS
GitLab UI:
Clone and open in Apple Xcode
Clone and open in Visual Studio Code
Clone and open in IntelliJ IDEA
Download repository source code
To download a repository’s source code as a compressed file:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Above the file list, select
Code
.
From the options, select the files you want to download:
Source code
:
Download the source code from the current branch you’re viewing.
Available extensions:
zip
,
tar
,
tar.gz
, and
tar.bz2
.
Directory
:
Download a specific directory. Visible only when you view a subdirectory.
Available extensions:
zip
,
tar
,
tar.gz
, and
tar.bz2
.
Artifacts
:
Download the artifacts from the latest CI/CD job.
The checksums of generated archives can change even if the repository itself doesn’t
change. For example, this occurs if Git or a third-party library that GitLab uses changes.
View repository by Git revision
To view all repository files and folders at a specific Git revision, such as a commit SHA,
branch name, or tag:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
At the top, select to open the
Select Git revision
dropdown list.
Select or search for a Git revision.
You can also view and browse files at a specific Git revision from the
commits
page.
Repository languages
GitLab detects programming languages used in the default branch.
This information is displayed on the
Project overview
page.
When new files are added, this information can take up to five minutes to update.
Add repository languages
Not all files are detected and listed on the
Project overview
page. Documentation,
vendor code, and
most markup languages
are excluded.
To view a list of supported files and languages, see
supported data types
.
To change this behavior and include additional file types in the default settings:
In your repository’s root directory, create a file named
.gitattributes
.
Add a line that tells GitLab to include a specific file type. For example,
to enable
.proto
files, add the following:
*.proto linguist-detectable=true
This feature can use excessive CPU. If you experience an issue, see the
Repository Languages: excessive CPU use
troubleshooting section.
Repository contributor analytics
You can view a line chart with the number of commits to the selected project branch over time,
and line charts with the number of commits by each project member.
For more information, see
Contributor analytics
.
Repository history graph
A repository graph displays a visual history of the repository network, including branches and merges.
This graph helps you see the flow of changes in the repository.
To view the repository history graph, go to your project’s
Code
>
Repository graph
.
Repository path changes
When a repository path changes, GitLab handles the transition from the
old location to the new one with a redirect.
When you
rename a user
,
change a group path
, or
rename a repository
:
URLs for the namespace and everything under it, like projects, are
redirected to the new URLs.
Git remote URLs for projects under the
namespace redirect to the new remote URL. When you push or pull to a
repository that has changed location, a warning message to update
your remote is displayed. Automation scripts or Git clients continue to
work after a rename.
The redirects are available as long as the original path is not claimed by
another group, user, or project.
API redirects
may need to be followed explicitly.
After you change a path, you must update the existing URL in the following resources:
Include statements
except
include:component
,
otherwise pipelines fail with a syntax error. CI/CD component references can follow redirects.
Namespaced API calls that use the
encoded path
instead of the numeric namespace and project IDs.
Docker image references
.
Variables that specify a project or namespace.
CODEOWNERS file
.

Troubleshooting
Search sequence of pushes to a repository
If it seems that a commit has gone “missing”, search the sequence of pushes to a repository.
This StackOverflow article
describes how you can end up in this state without a force push. Another cause can be a misconfigured
server hook
that changes a HEAD ref in a
git reset
operation.
If you look at the output from the sample code below for the target branch, you
see a discontinuity in the from/to commits as you step through the output.
The
commit_from
of each new push should equal the
commit_to
of the previous push.
A break in that sequence indicates one or more commits have been “lost” from the repository history.
Using the
rails console
,
the following example checks the last 100 pushes and prints the
commit_from
and
commit_to
entries:
p
=
Project
.
find_by_full_path
(
'project/path'
)
p
.
events
.
pushed_action
.
last
(
100
)
.
each
do
|
e
|
printf
"%-20.20s %8s...%8s (%s)"
,
e
.
push_event_payload
[
:ref
]
,
e
.
push_event_payload
[
:commit_from
]
,
e
.
push_event_payload
[
:commit_to
]
,
e
.
author
.
try
(
:username
)
end
;
nil

Error: Xcode fails to clone repository
GitLab provides an option to
restrict a list of allowed SSH keys
.
If your SSH key is not on the allowed list, you might encounter an error like
The repository rejected the provided credentials
.
To resolve this issue, create a new SSH key pair that meets the guidelines for
supported SSH key types
. After you generate a
supported SSH key, try cloning the repository again.
