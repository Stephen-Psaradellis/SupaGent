Grant users Kubernetes access
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
Status
: Beta
History
Introduced
in GitLab 16.1, with
flags
named
environment_settings_to_graphql
,
kas_user_access
,
kas_user_access_project
, and
expose_authorized_cluster_agents
. This feature is in
beta
.
Feature flag
environment_settings_to_graphql
removed
in GitLab 16.2.
Feature flags
kas_user_access
,
kas_user_access_project
, and
expose_authorized_cluster_agents
removed
in GitLab 16.2.
The
limit of agent connection sharing was raised
from 100 to 500 in GitLab 17.0
The
user_access
parameter
access_as
was made optional
in GitLab 18.3. Defaults to agent impersonation.
Changed
to allow the authorization of projects and groups that belong to different top-level groups in GitLab 18.4.
As an administrator of Kubernetes clusters in an organization, you can grant Kubernetes access to members
of a specific project or group.
Granting access also activates
the Dashboard for Kubernetes
for a project or group.
For GitLab Self-Managed instances, make sure you either:
Host your GitLab instance and
KAS
on the same domain.
Host KAS on a subdomain of GitLab. For example, GitLab on
gitlab.com
and KAS on
kas.gitlab.com
.
Configure Kubernetes access
Configure access when you want to grant users access
to a Kubernetes cluster.
Prerequisites:
The agent for Kubernetes is installed in the Kubernetes cluster.
You must have the Developer role or higher.
To configure access:
In the agent configuration file, define a
user_access
keyword with the following parameters:
projects
: A list of projects whose members should have access. You can authorize up to 500 projects.
groups
: A list of groups whose members should have access. You can authorize up to 500 groups. It grants access to the group and all its descendants.
access_as
: For access with agent identity, the value is
{ agent: {...} }
.
Authorized projects and groups must have the same top-level group or user namespace as the agent’s configuration project, unless the
instance level authorization
application setting is enabled.
After you configure access, requests are forwarded to the API server using
the agent service account.
For example:
# .gitlab/agents/my-agent/config.yaml
user_access
:
access_as
:
agent
:
{}
projects
:
-
id
:
group-1/project-1
-
id
:
group-2/project-2
groups
:
-
id
:
group-2
-
id
:
group-3/subgroup
Configure access with user impersonation
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
You can grant access to a Kubernetes cluster and transform
requests into impersonation requests for authenticated users.
Prerequisites:
The agent for Kubernetes is installed in the Kubernetes cluster.
You must have the Developer role or higher.
To configure access with user impersonation:
In the agent configuration file, define a
user_access
keyword with the following parameters:
projects
: A list of projects whose members should have access.
groups
: A list of groups whose members should have access.
access_as
: For user impersonation, the value is
{ user: {...} }
.
After you configure access, requests are transformed into impersonation requests for
authenticated users.
User impersonation workflow
The installed
agentk
impersonates the given users as follows:
UserName
is
gitlab:user:<username>
Groups
is:
gitlab:user
: Common to all requests coming from GitLab users.
gitlab:project_role:<project_id>:<role>
for each role in each authorized project.
gitlab:group_role:<group_id>:<role>
for each role in each authorized group.
Extra
carries additional information about the request:
agent.gitlab.com/id
: The agent ID.
agent.gitlab.com/username
: The username of the GitLab user.
agent.gitlab.com/config_project_id
: The agent configuration project ID.
agent.gitlab.com/access_type
: One of
personal_access_token
or
session_cookie
. Ultimate only.
Only projects and groups directly listed in the under
user_access
in the configuration
file are impersonated. For example:
# .gitlab/agents/my-agent/config.yaml
user_access
:
access_as
:
user
:
{}
projects
:
-
id
:
group-1/project-1
# group_id=1, project_id=1
-
id
:
group-2/project-2
# group_id=2, project_id=2
groups
:
-
id
:
group-2
# group_id=2
-
id
:
group-3/subgroup
# group_id=3, group_id=4
In this configuration:
If a user is a member of only
group-1
, they receive
only the Kubernetes RBAC groups
gitlab:project_role:1:<role>
.
If a user is a member of
group-2
, they receive both Kubernetes RBAC groups:
gitlab:project_role:2:<role>
,
gitlab:group_role:2:<role>
.
RBAC authorization
Impersonated requests require
ClusterRoleBinding
or
RoleBinding
to identify the resource permissions
inside Kubernetes. See
RBAC authorization
for the appropriate configuration.
For example, if you allow maintainers in
awesome-org/deployment
project (ID: 123) to read the Kubernetes workloads,
you must add a
ClusterRoleBinding
resource to your Kubernetes configuration:
apiVersion
:
rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind
:
ClusterRoleBinding
metadata
:
name
:
my-cluster-role-binding
roleRef
:
name
:
view
kind
:
ClusterRole
apiGroup
:
rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects
:
-
name
:
gitlab:project_role:123:maintainer
kind
:

Access a cluster with the Kubernetes API
History
Introduced
in GitLab 16.4.
You can configure an agent to allow GitLab users to access a cluster with the Kubernetes API.
Prerequisites:
You have an agent configured with the
user_access
entry.
Configure local access with the GitLab CLI (recommended)
You can use the
GitLab CLI
glab
to create or update
a Kubernetes configuration file to access the agent Kubernetes API.
Use
glab cluster agent
commands to manage cluster connections:
View a list of all the agents associated with your project:
glab cluster agent list --repo
'<group>/<project>'
# If your current working directory is the Git repository of the project with the agent, you can omit the --repo option:
glab cluster agent list
Use the numerical agent ID presented in the first column of the output to update your
kubeconfig
:
glab cluster agent update-kubeconfig --repo
'<group>/<project>'
--agent
'<agent-id>'
--use-context
Verify the update with
kubectl
or your preferred Kubernetes tooling:
kubectl get nodes
The
update-kubeconfig
command sets
glab cluster agent get-token
as a
credential plugin
for Kubernetes tools to retrieve a token. The
get-token
command creates and
returns a personal access token that is valid until the end of the current day.
Kubernetes tools cache the token until it expires, the API returns an authorization error, or the process exits. Expect all subsequent calls to your Kubernetes tooling to create a new token.
The
glab cluster agent update-kubeconfig
command supports a number of command line flags. You can view all supported flags with
glab cluster agent update-kubeconfig --help
.
Some examples:
# When the current working directory is the Git repository where the agent is registered the --repo / -R flag can be omitted
glab cluster agent update-kubeconfig --agent
'<agent-id>'
# When the --use-context option is specified the `current-context` of the kubeconfig file is changed to the agent context
glab cluster agent update-kubeconfig --agent
'<agent-id>'
--use-context
# The --kubeconfig flag can be used to specify an alternative kubeconfig path
glab cluster agent update-kubeconfig --agent
'<agent-id>'
--kubeconfig ~/gitlab.kubeconfig
Configure local access manually using a personal access token
You can configure access to a Kubernetes cluster using a long-lived personal access token:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Operate
>
Kubernetes clusters
and retrieve the numerical ID of the agent you want to access. You need the ID to construct the full API token.
Create a
personal access token
with the
k8s_proxy
scope. You need the access token to construct the full API token.
Construct
kubeconfig
entries to access the cluster:
Make sure that the proper
kubeconfig
is selected.
For example, you can set the
KUBECONFIG
environment variable.
Add the GitLab KAS proxy cluster to the
kubeconfig
:
kubectl config set-cluster <cluster_name> --server
"https://kas.gitlab.com/k8s-proxy"
The
server
argument points to the KAS address of your GitLab instance.
On GitLab.com, this is
https://kas.gitlab.com/k8s-proxy
.
You can get the KAS address of your instance when you register an agent.
Use your numerical agent ID and personal access token to construct an API token:
kubectl config set-credentials <gitlab_user> --token
"pat:<agent-id>:<token>"
Add the context to combine the cluster and the user:
kubectl config set-context <gitlab_agent> --cluster <cluster_name> --user <gitlab_user>
Activate the new context:
kubectl config use-context <gitlab_agent>
Check that the configuration works:
kubectl get nodes
The configured user can access your cluster with the Kubernetes API.
