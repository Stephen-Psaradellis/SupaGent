Protected branches enforce specific permissions on branches in GitLab to ensure code stability
and quality. Protected branches:
Control which users can merge and push code changes.
Prevent accidental deletion of critical branches.
Enforce code review and approval processes.
Manage Code Owner approval requirements.
Regulate force push permissions to maintain commit history.
Control access through both the UI and the Protected branches API.
The default branch for your repository is protected by default.
For more information about default branch settings, see
default branch
.
For information about how protection rules behave when a branch matches multiple rules or has
complex permission requirements, see
Protection rules
.
Protect a branch
Configure protected branches for individual projects or for all projects in a group.
In a project
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Maintainer role.
When granting a group

removed.
Group owners can create protected branches for a group. These settings are inherited
by all projects in the group and can’t be overridden by project settings.
Prerequisites:
You must have the Owner role for the group.
The group must be a top-level group. Subgroups are not supported.
To protect a branch for all the projects in a group:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your group. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Protected branches
.
Select
Add protected branch
.
In the
Branch
text box, type the branch name or a
wildcard
(
*
).
Branch names and wildcards are case-sensitive.
From the
Allowed to merge
list, select a role that can merge into this branch.
From the
Allowed to push and merge
list, select a role that can push to this branch.
Choose your preferences for the
Allowed to force push
and
Require approval from code owners
settings.
Select

.
Push and merge permissions
The
Allowed to merge
and
Allowed to push and merge
settings control different
aspects of branch protection:
Setting
Purpose
Default behavior (not configured)
Allowed to merge
Controls who can merge changes through merge requests and create new protected branches through the UI and API
No one can merge (unless they have
Allowed to push and merge
).
Allowed to push and merge
Controls who can push directly to existing protected branches and merge through merge requests
No one can push.
Allowed to push and merge
grants both push and merge capabilities.
Users with this permission can merge through merge requests even without
Allowed to merge
permission.
When you select
No one
for either
Allowed to merge
or
Allowed to push and merge
, the UI
clears other role selections.
This behavior differs from the API, where you can set multiple access levels simultaneously.
For more information about API behavior, see the
Protected branches API
.
Protection strategies by branch types
Different branch types require different protection levels based on their purpose and
security requirements.
For branches deployed to production environments:
Set
Allowed to merge
to
Maintainers
only.
Set
Allowed to push and merge
to
No one
(not empty).
Enable
Require approval from code owners
.
Consider requiring multiple approvals.
With this configuration, all changes require merge requests with maintainer approval.
For active development branches:
Set
Allowed to merge
to
Developers + Maintainers
.
Set
Allowed to push and merge
to
No one
(not empty).
With this configuration, developers can merge approved merge requests while requiring
all changes to go through code review.
When
Allowed to push and merge
is not configured, it does not restrict
push access. To prevent direct pushes, you must explicitly set
Allowed to push and merge
to
No one
.
Permission combinations for Developer role

different protection configurations:

Default branch protection settings
Administrators can
set a default branch protection level
in the
Admin
area.
Use wildcard rules
When using wildcards, multiple rules can apply to a single branch.
If more than one rule applies to a branch, the most permissive rule controls
how the branch behaves. For merge controls to work properly, set
Allowed to push and merge
to a broader set of users than
Allowed to merge
.
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Maintainer role.
To protect multiple branches at the same time:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Branch rules
.
Select
Add branch rule
>
Branch name or pattern
.
From the dropdown list, type the branch name and a wildcard (
*
).
Branch names and wildcards are case-sensitive. For example:

Configure protection options
You can set various protection options to secure your branches.
Require merge requests
You can force everyone to submit a merge request, rather than allowing them to
check in directly to a protected branch:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Branch rules
.
Next to your branch, select
View details
.
From the
Allowed to merge
section, select
Edit
Select
Developers + Maintainers
.
Select
Save changes
.
From the
Allowed to push and merge
section, select
No one
.
Select
Save changes
.
Allow direct push
You can allow everyone with write access to push directly to the protected branch.
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Branch rules
.
Next to your branch, select
View details
.
From the
Allowed to push and merge
section, select
Developers + Maintainers
.
Select
Save changes
.
With group permissions
To set the members of a group or subgroup as
Allowed to merge
or
Allowed to push and merge
to a protected branch:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Branch rules
.
Next to your branch, select
View details
.
In the
Allowed to merge
or
Allowed to push and merge
sections, select
Edit
.
Under
Groups
, search to add groups. For example:
# Allow group members to merge into this branch
Allowed to merge: @group-x
# Allow group members to push and merge into this branch
Allowed to push and merge: @group-x/subgroup-y
Select
Save changes
.
When you assign a group to a protected branch, only direct members of that group are included.
Members from parent groups are not automatically granted permissions to the protected branch.
Group inheritance requirements
%%{init: { "fontFamily": "GitLab Sans" }}%%
graph TD
accTitle: Diagram of group inheritance for protected branches
accDescr: If a project is shared with a group, the group members inherit permissions for protected branches.
A[Parent group X] -->|owns| B[Project A]
A -->|contains| C[Subgroup Y]
B -->|shared with| C
C -->|members inherit permissions| B
In this example:
Parent group X (
group-x
) owns Project A.
Parent group X also contains a subgroup, Subgroup Y. (
group-x/subgroup-y
)
Project A is shared with Subgroup Y.
The eligible groups for protected branch permissions are:
Project A: Both Group X and Subgroup Y, because Project A is shared with Subgroup Y.
Share projects with groups
You can share the project with a group or subgroup so that their members are eligible for
protected branch permissions.
%%{init: { "fontFamily": "GitLab Sans" }}%%
graph LR
accTitle: Diagram of project sharing for protected branch permissions
accDescr: Sharing a project with a group affects whether their members can have protected branch permissions.
A[Parent group X] -->|owns| B[Project A]
A -->|also contains| C[Subgroup Y]
C -.->D{Share Project A<br/>with Subgroup Y?} -.->|yes| E[Members of Subgroup Y<br/>can have protected<br/>branch permissions]
D{Share Project A<br/>with Subgroup Y?} -.->|no| F[Members of Subgroup Y<br />cannot have protected<br/>branch permissions]
E -.->|Add Subgroup Y<br/> to protected branch settings| I[Subgroup Y members<br/>can merge/push] -.-> B
F -.-> |Add Subgroup Y<br/> to protected branch settings| J[Settings will not<br/>take effect] -.-> B
To grant access to Subgroup Y members for Project A, you must share the project with
the subgroup. Adding the subgroup directly to the protected branch settings is not effective
and isn’t applicable to subgroup members.
For a group to have protected branch permissions, the project must be directly shared with the group.
Inherited project membership from parent groups is not sufficient for protected branch permissions.
Enable deploy key access
You can push to a protected branch with a
deploy key
.
Prerequisites:
The deploy key must be enabled for your project. A project deploy key is enabled by default when
it is created. However, a public deploy key must be granted access to the project.
The deploy key must have write access to your project repository.
The owner of the deploy key must have at least read access to the project.
The owner of the deploy key must also be a member of the project.
To allow a deploy key to push to a protected branch:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Branch rules
.
Next to your branch, select
View details
.
From the
Allowed to push and merge
section, select
Edit
.
In
Deploy keys
, search to add a deploy key.
Select
Save changes
.
Deploy keys are not available in the
Allowed to merge
dropdown list.
Allow force push
You can allow
force pushes
to
protected branches.
To protect a branch and enable force push:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Branch rules
.
Select
Add branch rule
>
Branch name or pattern
.
From the dropdown list, search for and select the branch you want to protect and enable force push.
Select
Create branch rule
. You are directed to the
Branch rule details
page.
From the
Allowed to push and merge
and
Allowed to merge
sections, select the settings you want.
Select
Save changes
.
To allow all users with push access to force push, turn on the
Allowed to force push
toggle.
To enable force pushes on branches that are already protected:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>

Next to your branch, select
View details
.
Turn on the
Allowed to force push
toggle.
Require Code Owner approval
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
For a protected branch, you can require at least one approval by a
Code Owner
.
If a branch is protected by multiple rules, code owner approval is required if
Required approval from code owners
enabled.
To protect a new branch and enable Code Owner’s approval:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Branch rules
.
Select
Add branch rule
>
Branch name or pattern
.
From the dropdown list, search for and select the branch you want to protect and enable force push.
Select
Create branch rule
. You are directed to the
Branch rule details
page.
From the
Allowed to push and merge
and
Allowed to merge
sections, select the settings you want.
Select
Save changes
.
Turn on the
Require approval from code owners
toggle.
To enable Code Owner’s approval on branches that are already protected:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
Repository
.
Expand
Branch rules
.
Next to your branch, select
View details
.
Turn on the
Code owner approval
toggle.
When enabled, all merge requests for these branches require approval
by a Code Owner per matched rule before they can be merged.
Additionally, direct pushes to the protected branch are denied if a rule is matched.
Any user who is not specified in the
CODEOWNERS
file cannot push
changes for the specified files or paths, unless they are specifically allowed to.
You don’t have to restrict developers from pushing directly to the
protected branch. Instead, you can restrict pushing to certain files where a review by
Code Owners is required.
Users and groups who are allowed to push to protected branches do not need a merge request to merge
their feature branches. Thus, they can skip merge request approval rules, Code Owners included.
Control who can unprotect branches
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
When you protect a branch, you can also control who can unprotect it later.
By default, users with at least the Maintainer role can unprotect protected branches.
For organizations with regulatory or compliance requirements, you can restrict these permissions to
specific users, groups, or access levels.
To avoid permanently locking protection settings for a branch, ensure at least one user or group
retains unprotect permissions for the branch at all times.
Users cannot create, modify, or delete protected branch settings unless they can unprotect the
branch themselves. This safety mechanism is in place to prevent configuration errors.
You can configure these permissions through the API only. Use this feature for:
Regulatory compliance: Ensure only authorized personnel can modify branch protections.
Large organizations: Prevent accidental removal of protections across multiple repositories.
Automated governance: Enable scripts to create admin-only protections that development teams
cannot override.
Unprotect permissions
The following table shows who can unprotect a branch based on your configuration:
Configuration
Who can unprotect
Default behavior
Users with at least the Maintainer role
Specific users configured
Only designated users
Specific groups configured
Only members of designated groups
Multiple access levels configured
Any user, group, or role from the configured access levels
CI/CD on protected branches
The permission to merge or push to protected branches defines
whether or not a user can run CI/CD pipelines and execute actions on jobs.
Merge request pipelines run on the source branch or a merge request reference based on the source branch. A pipeline isn’t created if the user doesn’t have permission to merge or push to the source branch.
When a merge request is between protected branches, protected variables and runners are available to
the pipeline if the user has permission to update both the source and target branches.
For more information, see
Control access to protected variables and runners
.
Create protected branches
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Developer role.
To create a protected branch, branch protection must be configured to
require everyone to submit merge requests for a protected branch
.
To create a new branch with protections:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Code
>
Branches
.
Select
New branch
.
Fill in the branch name and select an existing branch, tag, or commit to
base the new branch on. If you require everyone to submit merge requests for a protected branch,
only existing protected branches and commits that are already in protected branches are accepted.
You can also use the Branches API to create a branch with protections.
If branch protection is configured to
allow everyone to push directly to a protected branch
, a branch with protections can also be created from the command line or a Git client application.
Delete protected branches
Users with at least the Maintainer role can manually delete protected
branches by using the GitLab web interface:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Code
>
Branches
.
Next to the branch you want to delete, select
More actions
(
ellipsis_v
).
Select
Delete protected branch
.
On the confirmation dialog, enter the branch name and select
Yes, delete protected branch
.
Branch names are case-sensitive.
You can only delete protected branches with the GitLab UI or API.
You cannot delete protected branches with local Git commands or third-party Git clients.
Policy enforcement
For security and compliance, you may implement a
merge request approval policy
which affects settings otherwise defined in your instance, group, or projects. Policies may affect users ability to unprotect or delete branches, push or force push.
