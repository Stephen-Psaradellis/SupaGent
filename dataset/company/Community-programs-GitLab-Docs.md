Meeting GitLab for Open Source Program requirements
To meet GitLab for Open Source Program requirements, first add an OSI-approved open source license to all projects in your namespace.
To add a license to a project:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
On the overview page, select
Add LICENSE
. If the license you want is not available as a license template, manually copy the entire, unaltered
text of your chosen license
into the
LICENSE
file. GitLab defaults to
All rights reserved
if users do not perform this action.
Applicants must add the correct license to each project in their respective groups or namespaces. When you’re sure you’re using OSI-approved licenses for your projects, you can take your screenshots.
GitLab for Open Source Program benefits apply to an entire GitLab namespace. To qualify for the GitLab for Open Source Program, all projects in your namespace must meet program requirements.
Verification for Open Source Program
The verification process depends on where your projects are hosted:
For projects on GitLab.com, verification is automatic.
For projects on GitLab Self-Managed, when you submit your request, you must provide a link to the publicly accessible namespace that contains the projects.
GitLab verifies three aspects of your namespace:
The namespace must be publicly accessible.
Each project in the namespace must use an
OSI-approved license
.
Projects in the namespace must be publicly visible, except one private project is allowed for security purposes.
Benefits of the GitLab Open Source Program apply to all projects in a GitLab namespace. All projects in an eligible namespace must meet program requirements.

For qualifying startups, the
GitLab for Startups
program provides GitLab Ultimate, plus 50,000 compute minutes per month for 12 months. For more information, including instructions for applying to the program and renewing program membership, see the
