Issue boards provide a visual way to manage and track work in GitLab.
Issue boards:
Display issues as cards in customizable lists based on labels, milestones, or assignees.
Track issues through different stages of your workflow.
Support agile methodologies like Kanban and Scrum.
Organize multiple boards for different teams and projects.
Visualize workload and progress across your entire process.
Your issues appear as cards in vertical lists, organized by their assigned
labels
,
milestones
,
iterations
,
assignees
or
status
.
Add metadata to your issues, then create the corresponding list for your existing issues.
When you’re ready, you can drag your issue cards from one list to another.
Issue boards can power common frameworks like
Kanban
and
Scrum
.
To let your team members organize their own workflows, use
multiple issue boards
. This allows creating multiple issue
boards in the same project.
Different issue board features are available in different
GitLab tiers

Multiple issue boards
Multiple issue boards allow for more than one issue board for:
A project in all tiers
A group in the Premium and Ultimate tier
Multiple issue boards are great for large projects with more than one team, in which a repository hosts
the code of multiple products and when you want to create boards to power different workflows across
the software development lifecycle.
Using the search box at the top of the menu, you can filter the listed boards.
When you have ten or more boards available, a
Recent
section is also shown in the menu, with
shortcuts to your last four visited boards.
When you’re revisiting an issue board in a project or group with multiple boards,
GitLab automatically loads the last board you visited.
Create an issue board
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
To create a new issue board:
In the upper-left corner of the issue board page, select the dropdown list with the current board name.
Select
Create new board
.
Enter the new board’s name and select its scope: milestone, iteration, labels, assignee, or weight.
Select
Create board
Delete an issue board
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project or group where the board is saved.
To delete the open issue board:
In the upper-right corner of the issue board page, select
Configure board
(
settings
).
Select
Delete board
.
Select
Delete
to confirm.
If the board you’ve deleted was the last one, a new
Development
board is created.
Issue boards use cases
You can tailor GitLab issue boards to your own preferred workflow.
For workflow-based documentation, see
Tutorials: Plan and track your work
.
Use cases for a single issue board
With the
GitLab Flow
you can
discuss proposals in issues, label them, and organize and prioritize them with issue boards.
For example, let’s consider this simplified development workflow:
You have a repository that hosts your application’s codebase, and your team actively contributes code.
Your
backend
team starts working on a new implementation, gathers feedback and approval, and
passes it over to the
frontend
team.
When frontend is complete, the new feature is deployed to a
staging
environment to be tested.
When successful, it’s deployed to
production
.
If you have the labels
Backend
,
Frontend
,
Staging
, and
Production
, and an issue board with a list for each, you can:
Visualize the entire flow of implementations since the beginning of the development lifecycle
until deployed to production.
Prioritize the issues in a list by moving them vertically.
Move issues between lists to organize them according to the labels you’ve set.
Add multiple issues to lists in the board by selecting one or more existing issues.
Scrum team
In a Scrum team, use
multiple issue boards
so that each scrum team has their own board.
On the Scrum board, you can easily move issues through each
part of the process. For example:
To Do
,
Doing
, and
Done
.
Quick assignments
To quickly assign issues to your team members:
Create
assignee lists
for each team member.
Drag an issue onto the team member’s list.
Issue board terminology
An
issue board
represents a unique view of your issues. It can have multiple lists with each
list consisting of issues represented by cards.
A
list
is a column on the issue board that displays issues matching certain attributes.
In addition to the default “Open” and “Closed” lists, each additional list shows issues matching
your chosen label, assignee, or milestone. On the top of each list you can see the number of issues
that belong to it. Types of lists include:
Open
(default): all open issues that do not belong to one of the other lists.
Always appears as the leftmost list.
Closed
(default): all closed issues. Always appears as the rightmost list.
Label list
: all open issues for a label.
Assignee list
: all open issues assigned to a user.
Milestone list
: all open issues for a milestone.
Iteration list
: all open issues for an iteration.
Status list
: all issues having a status.
A
Card
is a box on a list, and it represents an issue. You can drag cards from one list to
another to change their label, assignee, or milestone. The information you can see on a
card includes:
Issue title
Associated labels
Issue number
Assignee
Weight
Milestone
Iteration (in the Premium and Ultimate tier)
Due date
Time tracking estimate
Health status
A
swimlane
is a horizontal grouping of issues on the issue board, for example by parent epic.
Ordering issues in a list
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
When an issue is created, the system assigns a relative order value that is greater than the maximum value
of that issue’s project or top-level group. This means the issue is at the bottom of any issue list that
it appears in.
When you visit a board, issues appear ordered in any list. You’re able to change
that order by dragging the issues. The changed order is saved, so that anybody who visits the same
board later sees the reordering, with some exceptions.
Any time you drag and reorder the issue, its relative order value changes accordingly.
Then, any time that issue appears in any board, the ordering is done according to
the updated relative order value. If a user in your GitLab instance
drags issue
A
above issue
B
, the ordering is maintained when these two issues are subsequently
loaded in any board in the same instance.
This could be a different project board or a different group
board, for example.
This ordering also affects
issue lists
.
Changing the order in an issue board changes the ordering in an issue list,
and vice versa.
Focus mode
In focus mode, the navigation UI is hidden, allowing you to focus on issues in the board.
To enable or disable focus mode, in the upper-right corner, select
Toggle focus mode
(
maximize
).
Group issue boards
Accessible at the group navigation level, a group issue board offers the same features as a project-level board.
It can display issues from all projects that fall under the group and its descendant subgroups.
Users on GitLab Free can use a single group issue board.
GitLab Enterprise features for issue boards
GitLab issue boards are available on the GitLab Free tier, but some
advanced functionality is present in
higher tiers only
.
Configurable issue boards
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
An issue board can be associated with a
milestone
,
labels
, assignee, weight, and current
iteration
,
which automatically filter the board issues accordingly.
This allows you to create unique boards according to your team’s need.
You can define the scope of your board when creating it or by selecting the
Configure board
(
settings
) button.
After a milestone, iteration, assignee, or weight is assigned to an issue board, you can no longer
filter through these in the search bar. To do that, you need to remove the desired scope
(for example, milestone, assignee, or weight) from the issue board.
If you don’t have editing permission in a board, you’re still able to see the configuration by
selecting
Board configuration
(
settings
).
Assignee lists
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

Group issues in swimlanes
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
With swimlanes you can visualize issues grouped by epic.
Your issue board keeps all the other features, but with a different visual organization of issues.
This feature is available both at the project and group level.
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project.

To assign an issue to another epic, drag it to the epic’s horizontal lane.
To remove an issue from an epic, drag it to the
Issues with no epic assigned
lane.
To move an issue to another epic and another list, at the same time, drag the issue diagonally.
Sum of issue weights
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
The top of each list indicates the sum of issue weights for the issues that
belong to that list. This is useful when using boards for capacity allocation,
especially in combination with
assignee lists
.
Work in progress limits
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
History
Setting limits by weight
introduced
in GitLab 17.11.
You can set a work in progress (WIP) limit for each issue list on an issue board.
When a limit is set, the current state and configured limit are shown in the board list header.
A line in the list separates items within the limit from those in excess of the limit.
You cannot set a WIP limit on the default lists (
Open
and
Closed
).
Types of limits
GitLab supports two types of WIP limits:
Items
: Limits the number of issues in a list regardless of their weight.
The board header shows the number of issues in the list and the item limit.
For example, if there are 4 issues and an item limit of 3, the header shows
4/3
.
Weight
: Limits the total weight of issues in a list.
The board header shows the total weight of issues in the list and the weight limit.
For example, if there are issues with weights adding up to 8 and a weight limit of 5, the header shows
8/5
.
Examples:
When you have a list with four issues and an item limit of five, the header shows
4/5
.
If you exceed the limit, the current number of issues is shown in red.
You have a list with five issues with an item limit of five. When you move another issue to that list,
the list’s header displays
6/5
, with the six shown in red. The work in progress limit line is shown before the sixth issue.
When using weight limits, if you have three issues with weights of 1, 2, and 5 (total weight of 8) and a weight limit of 5, the header shows
8/5
with the 8 in red. The work in progress limit line appears after the issues whose combined weight is within the limit, separating them from issues that exceed the limit.
Set work in progress limit
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
To set a WIP limit for a list, in an issue board:
On the top of the list you want to edit, select
Edit list settings
(
settings
).
The list settings sidebar opens on the right.
Next to
Work in progress limit
, select
Edit
.
Choose the limit type from the dropdown list:
Items
: To limit by the number of issues.
Weight
: To limit by the total weight of issues.
Enter the maximum number of items or maximum weight.
Press
Enter
to save.
To remove a WIP limit, select
Remove limit
.
Blocked issues
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
If an issue is
blocked by another issue
, an icon appears next to its title to indicate its blocked
status.
When you hover over the blocked icon (
entity-blocked
), a detailed information popover is displayed.
Actions you can take on an issue board

To move and reorder lists, drag them around.
Alternatively, you can select the
New list
at the right end of the board.
The new list is inserted at the right end of the lists, before
Closed
.
Remove a list
Removing a list doesn’t have any effect on issues and labels, as it’s just the
list view that’s removed. You can always create it again later if you need.
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
To remove a list from an issue board:
On the top of the list you want to remove, select

(
settings
).
The list settings sidebar opens on the right.
Select
Remove list
.
On the confirmation dialog, select
Remove list
again.
Add issues to a list
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
If your board is scoped to one or more attributes, go to the issues you want to add and apply the
same attributes as your board scope.
For example, to add an issue to a list scoped to the
Doing
label, in a group issue board:
Go to an issue in the group or one of the subgroups or projects.
Add the
Doing
label.
The issue should now show in the
Doing
list on your issue board.
Remove an issue from a list
When an issue should no longer belong to a list, you can remove it.
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
The steps depend on the scope of the list:
To open the right sidebar, select the issue card.
Remove what’s keeping the issue in the list.
If it’s a label list, remove the label. If it’s an
assignee list
, unassign the user.
Filter issues
You can use the filters on top of your issue board to show only
the results you want. It’s similar to the filtering used in the
issue tracker
.
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for the project.
You can filter by the following:
Assignee
Author
Epic
Iteration
Label
Milestone
My reaction
Release
Type (issue/incident)
Weight
Status
Filtering issues in a group board
When
filtering issues
in a
group
board, keep this behavior in mind:
Milestones: you can filter by the milestones belonging to the group and its descendant groups.
Labels: you can only filter by the labels belonging to the group but not its descendant groups.
When you edit issues individually using the right sidebar, you can additionally select the
milestones and labels from the
project
that the issue is from.
Move issues and lists
You can move issues and lists by dragging them.
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Planner role for a project in GitLab.
To move an issue, select the issue card and drag it to another position in its current list or
into a different list. Learn about possible effects in
Dragging issues between lists
.
To move a list, select its top bar, and drag it horizontally.
You can’t move the
Open
and
Closed
lists, but you can hide them when editing an issue board.
Move an issue to the start of the list
History
Introduced
in GitLab 15.4.
You can move issues to the top of the list with a menu shortcut.
Your issue is moved to the top of the list even if other issues are hidden by a filter.
Prerequisites:
You must at least have the Planner role for the project.
To move an issue to the start of the list:
In an issue board, hover over the card of the issue you want to move.
Select
Card options
(
ellipsis_v
), then
Move to start of list
.
Move an issue to the end of the list
History
Introduced
in GitLab 15.4.
You can move issues to the bottom of the list with a menu shortcut.
Your issue is moved to the bottom of the list even if other issues are hidden by a filter.
Prerequisites:
You must at least have the Planner role for the project.
To move an issue to the end of the list:
In an issue board, hover over the card of the issue you want to move.
Select
Card options
(
ellipsis_v
), then
Move to end of list
.
Dragging issues between lists
To move an issue to another list, select the issue card and drag it onto that list.
When you drag issues between lists, the result is different depending on the source list
and the target list.
To Open
To Closed
To label B list
To assignee Bob list
From Open
-
Close issue
Add label B
Assign Bob
From Closed
Reopen issue
-
Reopen issue and add label B
Reopen issue and assign Bob
From label A list
Remove label A
Close issue
Remove label A and add label B
Assign Bob
From assignee Alice list
Unassign Alice
Close issue
Add label B
Unassign Alice and assign Bob
Tips
A few things to remember:
Moving an issue between lists removes the label from the list it came from
and adds the label from the list it goes to.
An issue can exist in multiple lists if it has more than one label.
Lists are populated with issues automatically if the issues are labeled.
Selecting the issue title inside a card takes you to that issue.
Selecting a label inside a card quickly filters the entire issue board
and show only the issues from all lists that have that label.
When an issue is moved from a status list to an open list, the default open status is applied.
Similarly, when it’s moved to a closed list, the default closed status is applied.
For performance and visibility reasons, each list shows the first 20 issues
by default. If you have more than 20 issues, start scrolling down and the next
20 appear.
Troubleshooting issue boards
There was a problem fetching users
on group issue board when filtering by Author or Assignee
If you get a banner with
There was a problem fetching users
error when filtering by author or assignee on
group issue board, make sure that you are added as a member to the current group.
Non-members do not have permission to list group members when filtering by author or assignee on issue boards.
To fix this error, you should add all of your users to the top-level group with at least the Guest role.
Use Rails console to fix issue boards not loading and timing out
If you see issue board not loading and timing out in UI, use Rails console to call the Issue Rebalancing service to fix it:
Start a Rails console session
.
Run these commands:
p
=
Project
.
find_by_full_path
(
'<username-or-group>/<project-name>'
)
Issues
::
RelativePositionRebalancingService
.
new
(
p
.
root_namespace
.
all_projects
)
.
execute
To exit the Rails console, type
quit
.
