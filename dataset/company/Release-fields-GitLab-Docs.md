Release fields | GitLab Docs
Release fields
The following fields are available when you create or edit a release.
Title
The release title can be customized using the
Release title
field when
creating or editing a release. If no title is provided, the release’s tag name
is used instead.
Tag name
The release tag name should include the release version. GitLab uses
Semantic Versioning
for our releases, and we recommend you do too. Use
(Major).(Minor).(Patch)
, as detailed in the
GitLab Policy for Versioning
.
For example, for GitLab version
16.10.1
:
16
represents the major version. The major release was
16.0.0
, but often referred to as
16.0
.
10
represents the minor version. The minor release was
16.10.0
, but often referred to as
16.10
.
1
represents the patch number.
Any part of the version number can be multiple digits, for example,
16.10.11
.
Release notes description
Every release has a description. You can add any text you like, but we recommend
including a changelog to describe the content of your release. This helps users
quickly scan the differences between each release you publish.
Tagging messages in Git
can
be included in Release note descriptions by selecting
Include tag message in
the release notes
.
Description supports
Markdown
.
Release assets
A release contains the following types of assets:
Source code
Link to related materials
Source code
GitLab automatically generates
zip
,
tar.gz
,
tar.bz2
, and
tar
archived source code from the given Git tag. These assets are read-only,
and
can be downloaded
.
Links
A link is any URL which can point to whatever you like: documentation, built
binaries, or other related materials. These can be both internal or external
links from your GitLab instance.
Each link as an asset has the following attributes:
Attribute
Required
Description
name
Yes
The name of the link.
url
Yes
The URL to download a file.
filepath
No
The redirect link to the
url
. Must start with a slash (
/
). See
this section
for more information.
link_type
No
The content kind of what users can download with
url
. See
this section
for more information.
Permanent links to release assets
History
Introduced
in GitLab 15.9, links for private releases can be accessed using a personal access token.
The assets associated with a release are accessible through a permanent URL.
GitLab always redirects this URL to the actual asset
location, so even if the assets move to a different location, you can continue
to use the same URL. This is defined during
link creation
or
updating
using the
filepath
API attribute.
The format of the URL is:
https://host/namespace/project/-/releases/:release/downloads:filepath
If you have an asset for the
v16.9.0-rc2
release in the
gitlab-org
namespace and
gitlab-runner
project on
gitlab.com
, for example:
{
"name"
:
"linux amd64"
,
"filepath"
:
"/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64"
,
"url"
:
"https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/v16.9.0-rc2/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64"
,
"link_type"
:
"other"
}
This asset has a direct link of:
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/releases/v16.9.0-rc2/downloads/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64
The physical location of the asset can change at any time and the direct link remains unchanged.
If the release is private, you need to provide a personal access token with either
api
or
read_api
scopes using
a
private_token
query parameter or a
HTTP_PRIVATE_TOKEN
header when making the request. For example:
curl --location --output filename
"https://gitlab.example.com/my-group/my-project/-/releases/myrelease/downloads/<path-to-file>?private_token=<your_access_token>"
curl --location --output filename --header
"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>"
"https://gitlab.example.com/my-group/my-project/-/releases/myrelease/downloads/<path-to-file>"
Permanent links to latest release assets
You can use the
filepath
from
permanent links to release assets
in combination with a
permanent link to the latest release
. The
filepath
must start with a slash (
/
).
The format of the URL is:
https://host/namespace/project/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads:filepath
You can use this format to provide a permanent link to an asset from the latest release.
If you have an asset with
filepath
for the
v16.9.0-rc2
latest release in the
gitlab-org
namespace and
gitlab-runner
project on
gitlab.com
, for example:
{
"name"
:
"linux amd64"
,
"filepath"
:
"/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64"
,
"url"
:
"https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/v16.9.0-rc2/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64"
,
"link_type"
:
"other"
}
This asset has a direct link of:
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64
Link Types
The four types of links are “Runbook,” “Package,” “Image,” and “Other.”
The
link_type
parameter accepts one of the following four values:
runbook
package
image
other
(default)
This field has no effect on the URL and it’s only used for visual purposes in the Releases page of your project.
Use a generic package for attaching binaries
You can use
generic packages
to store any artifacts from a release or tag pipeline,
that can also be used for attaching binary files to an individual release entry.
You basically need to:
Push the artifacts to the Generic package registry
.
Attach the package link to the release
.
The following example generates release assets, publishes them
as a generic package, and then creates a release:
stages
:
-
build
-
upload
-
release
variables
:
# Package version can only contain numbers (0-9), and dots (.).
# Must be in the format of X.Y.Z, and should match the /\A\d+\.\d+\.\d+\z/ regular expression.
# See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/generic_packages/#publish-a-package-file
PACKAGE_VERSION
:
"1.2.3"
DARWIN_AMD64_BINARY
:
"myawesomerelease-darwin-amd64-${PACKAGE_VERSION}"
LINUX_AMD64_BINARY
:
"myawesomerelease-linux-amd64-${PACKAGE_VERSION}"
PACKAGE_REGISTRY_URL
:

PowerShell users may need to escape the double quote
"
inside a JSON
string with a
`
(back tick) for
--assets-link
and
ConvertTo-Json
before passing on to the
release-cli
.
For example:
release
:
script
:
-
$env:assets = "[{`"name`":`"MyFooAsset`",`"url`":`"https://gitlab.com/upack/artifacts/download/$env:UPACK_GROUP/$env:UPACK_NAME/$($env:GitVersion_SemVer)?contentOnly=zip`"}]"
-
$env:assetsjson = $env:assets | ConvertTo-Json
-
glab release create $env:CI_COMMIT_TAG --name "Release $env:CI_COMMIT_TAG" --notes "Release $env:CI_COMMIT_TAG" --ref $env:CI_COMMIT_TAG --assets-links=$env:assetsjson
Directly attaching
job artifacts
links to a release is not recommended, because artifacts are ephemeral and
are used to pass data in the same pipeline. This means there’s a risk that
they could either expire or someone might manually delete them.
