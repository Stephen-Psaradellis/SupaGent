Plan and track work
Plan your work by creating requirements, issues, and epics. Schedule work
with milestones and track your team’s time. Learn how to save time with
quick actions, see how GitLab renders Markdown text, and learn how to
use Git to interact with GitLab.
For a thorough demo of Plan features, see
Multi-team planning with GitLab Ultimate
.
In this video, Gabe describes a use case of a multi-team organization that uses GitLab
with Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe).
Alternatively, to learn how to map the SAFe to what you can do in GitLab see
SAFe without silos in GitLab
.
