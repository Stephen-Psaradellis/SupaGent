Manage billing account
Customers Portal is your comprehensive self-service hub for
managing GitLab subscriptions
and billing.
You can purchase GitLab products, manage your subscriptions throughout the entire subscription lifecycle, view and pay invoices,
and access your billing details and contact information.
If you made your purchase through an authorized reseller, you must contact them directly to make changes to your subscription.

Subscription and billing contacts
Users involved in subscription management can have three distinct roles
with varying levels of permissions and visibility into the subscription:
Billing account manager: Has access to view and edit subscriptions, payment methods, and billing account settings. Can pay and download invoices, and update the subscription contact to any listed billing account manager.
Subscription contact (or “Sold to” contact): The subscription owner and primary contact
for your billing account. Receives notifications about subscription events and information
about applying the subscription. This role is also a billing account manager by default.
Billing contact (or “Bill to” contact): Receives all invoices and notifications about
subscription events. Does not have a Customers Portal account with access to the subscription
unless this role is also a billing account manager.

Tax ID for non-US customers
A Tax ID is a unique number assigned by tax authorities to businesses registered for Value Added Tax (VAT), Goods and Services Tax (GST), or similar indirect taxes.
Providing a valid Tax ID may reduce your tax burden by allowing us to apply reverse charge mechanisms instead of charging VAT/GST on your invoices. Without a valid Tax ID, applicable VAT/GST rates are based on your location.
If your business is not registered for indirect taxes (due to size thresholds or other
reasons), GitLab applies the standard VAT/GST rate according to local regulations.
For detailed Tax ID formats by country and additional information, see our
complete Tax ID reference guide
.

Contact us
page.
Access resources, services, and contact options of the sales, billing, and support teams
to get quick access to the help you need.
Subscription purchased through a reseller
If you purchased a subscription through an authorized reseller (including GCP and AWS marketplaces), you have access to Customers Portal to:
View your subscription.
Associate your subscription with the relevant group (GitLab.com) or download the license (GitLab Self-Managed).
Manage contact information.
Other changes and requests must be done through the reseller, including:
Changes to the subscription.
Purchase of additional seats, Storage, or Compute.
Requests for invoices, because those are issued by the reseller, not GitLab.
Resellers do not have access to Customers Portal, or their customers’ accounts.
After your subscription order is processed, you will receive several emails:
A “Welcome to the Customers Portal” email, including instructions on how to sign in.
A purchase confirmation email with instructions on how to provision access.
Billing and subscription contact’s names don’t match
If the billing account manager’s email is linked to contacts with different first or last names,
you will be prompted to update the name.
If you are the billing account manager, follow the instructions to
update your personal profile
.
If you are not the billing account manager, notify them to update their personal profile.
Subscription contact is no longer account manager
If the subscription contact is no longer a billing account manager, you will be prompted to select a new contact.
Follow the instructions to
change your subscription contact
.
Error:
Email has already been taken
If the email address you want to register with is already in use in Customers Portal, you can either:
