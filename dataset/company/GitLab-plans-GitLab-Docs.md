To choose the right GitLab subscription, select an offering and a tier.
Choose an offering
Choose which GitLab offering suits your needs:
GitLab.com: The GitLab software-as-a-service offering.
You don’t need to install anything to use GitLab.com, you only need to
sign up
and start using GitLab straight away.
The subscription applies to a top-level group namespace.
You cannot apply a subscription to a personal namespace.
GitLab Dedicated
: A single-tenant SaaS service for highly regulated and large enterprises.
GitLab Self-Managed: Install, administer, and maintain your own GitLab instance.
The subscription provides the same set of features for all users.
Subscriptions cannot be transferred between GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed.
If you want to switch to a different GitLab offering, you must purchase and apply a new subscription.
Choose a subscription tier
Pricing is
tier-based
, allowing you to choose
the features that fit your budget.

Duo Chat, and more.

Storage
: Buy more storage when you exceed your
free 10 GiB storage quota.
Compute minutes
