Use of generative AI
Some content on
docs.gitlab.com
was created with the assistance of generative AI tools.
All content, AI-generated or human-created, is reviewed for accuracy and readability by a GitLab team member.
Translations of English documentation into other languages are created using a mix of human translation, automation, and AI-assisted translation.
AI-assisted translations can appear in the documentation before human review is complete, or with only limited human review, to give non-English users faster access to the latest information.
AI-assisted translations will be reviewed by a human and updated as needed for quality and accuracy.
The English language documentation serves as the authoritative source.
For more information about making AI-generated contributions to GitLab documentation, see our
DCO or our CLA terms
