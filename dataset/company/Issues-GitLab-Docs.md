Issues help you collaborate with your team to plan, track, and deliver work in GitLab.
Issues:
Track feature proposals, tasks, support requests, and bug reports.
Organize and prioritize work with assignees, due dates, and health status.
Facilitate team discussion and decision-making through comments and threaded discussions.
Support custom workflows through templates, labels, epics, and boards.
Integrate with external tools like Zoom, Jira, and email services.
For more information about issues, see the GitLab blog post:
Always start a discussion with an issue
.
Issues are always associated with a specific project. If you have multiple
projects in a group, you can view all of the projects’ issues at once.
