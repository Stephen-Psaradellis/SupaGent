Two-factor authentication
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an additional level of security to your GitLab account. For others to access
your account, they would need your username and password and access to your second factor of authentication.
GitLab supports as a second factor of authentication:
One-time password authenticators (
OTP
). When enabled, GitLab prompts
you for a code when you sign in. Codes are generated by your OTP authenticator (for example, a password
manager on one of your devices).
WebAuthn devices. You’re prompted to activate your WebAuthn device (usually by pressing a button on it) when
you supply your username and password to sign in. This performs secure authentication on your behalf.
If you set up a device, also set up an OTP so you can still access your account if you lose the device.
Use personal access tokens with two-factor authentication
When 2FA is enabled, you can’t use your password to authenticate with Git over HTTPS or the
GitLab API
.
You can use a
personal access token
instead.
OAuth credential helpers
The following Git credential helpers authenticate to GitLab using OAuth. This is compatible with two-factor authentication. The first time you authenticate, the helper opens the web browser and GitLab asks you to authorize the app. Subsequent authentication requires no interaction.
Git Credential Manager
Git Credential Manager
(GCM) authenticates by default using OAuth. GCM supports GitLab.com without any manual configuration. To use GCM with GitLab Self-Managed, see
GitLab support
.
So you do not need to re-authenticate on every push, GCM supports caching as well as a variety of platform-specific credential stores that persist between sessions. This feature is useful whether you use personal access tokens or OAuth.
Git for Windows includes Git Credential Manager.
Git Credential Manager is developed primarily by GitHub, Inc. It is an open-source project and is supported by the community.
git-credential-oauth
git-credential-oauth
supports GitLab.com and several popular public hosts without any manual configuration needed. To use with GitLab Self-Managed, see the
git-credential-oauth custom hosts documentation
.
Many Linux distributions include git-credential-oauth as a package.
git-credential-oauth is an open-source project supported by the community.
Enable two-factor authentication
You can enable 2FA using a:
OTP authenticator. After you enable 2FA, back up your
recovery codes
.
WebAuthn device.
Your account email must be confirmed to enable 2FA.
Enable a one-time password authenticator
To enable 2FA with an OTP authenticator:
In GitLab
:
Access your
User settings
.
Select
Account
.
Select
Enable Two-factor Authentication
.
On your device (usually your phone)
:
Install a compatible application. For example:
Cloud-based (recommended because you can restore access if you lose the hardware device):
Authy
.
Cisco Duo
.
Other (proprietary):
Google Authenticator
.
Microsoft Authenticator
.
Other (Free Software)
Aegis Authenticator
.
FreeOTP
.
In the application, add a new entry in one of two ways:
Scan the code displayed by GitLab with your device’s camera to add the entry automatically.
Enter the details provided to add the entry manually.
In GitLab
:
Enter the six-digit pin number from the entry on your device into
Pin code
.
Enter your current password.
Select
Submit
.
If you entered the correct pin, GitLab displays a list of
recovery codes
. Download them and keep them
in a safe place.

Set up a WebAuthn device
History
Optional one-time password authentication for WebAuthn devices
introduced
in GitLab 15.10
with a feature flag
named
webauthn_without_totp
.
Generally available
in GitLab 17.6. Feature flag
webauthn_without_totp
removed.
WebAuthn is
supported by
the following:
Desktop browsers:
Chrome
Edge
Firefox
Opera
Safari
Mobile browsers:
Chrome for Android
Firefox for Android
iOS Safari (since iOS 13.3)
To set up 2FA with a WebAuthn-compatible device:
Optional.
Set up an OTP authenticator
.
Access your
User settings
.
Select
Account
.
Select
Enable Two-Factor Authentication
.
Plug in your WebAuthn device.
Enter a device name and in GitLab 15.10 and later, your GitLab account password.
You might not need to enter this password if you have signed in through your
identity provider.
Select
Set up New WebAuthn Device
.
Depending on your device, you might have to press a button or touch a sensor.
You should receive a message indicating that you successfully set up your device.
When you set up 2FA with a WebAuthn-compatible device, that device is linked to
a specific browser on a specific computer. Depending on the browser and WebAuthn
device, you might be able to configure settings to use the WebAuthn device on a
different browser or computer.
If this is the first time you have set up 2FA, you
must
download recovery codes
so you can recover access to your
account if you lose access.
You can lose access to your account if you clear your browser data.
Recovery codes
Immediately after successfully enabling 2FA with an OTP authenticator, you’re prompted to download
a set of generated recovery codes. If you ever lose access to your OTP authenticator, you can use one of
these recovery codes to sign in to your account.
Each code can be used only once to sign in to your account.
You should copy and print the codes, or use
Download codes
to download them for storage in a safe
place. If you choose to download them, the file is called
gitlab-recovery-codes.txt
.
Recovery codes are not generated for WebAuthn devices.
gitlab-sshd
is not suitable for regenerating recovery codes.
If you lose the recovery codes, or want to generate new ones, you can use either:
The
2FA account settings
page.
SSH
.
Regenerate two-factor authentication recovery codes
To regenerate 2FA recovery codes, you need access to a desktop browser:
Access your
User settings
.
Select
Account
>
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
.
If you’ve already configured 2FA, select
Manage two-factor authentication
.
In the
Disable two-factor authentication
section, select
Regenerate recovery codes
.
On the dialog, enter your current password and select
Regenerate recovery codes
.
If you regenerate 2FA recovery codes, save them. You can’t use any previously created 2FA codes.
Sign in with two-factor authentication enabled
Signing in with 2FA enabled is only slightly different than the typical sign-in process. Enter your username and password
and you’re presented with a second prompt, depending on which type of 2FA you’ve enabled.
Sign in using a one-time password authenticator
When asked, enter the pin from your OTP authenticator or a recovery code to sign in.
Sign in using a WebAuthn device
In supported browsers, you should be automatically prompted to activate your WebAuthn device (for example, by touching
or pressing its button) after entering your credentials.
A message displays indicating that your device responded to the authentication request and you’re automatically signed
in.
Disable two-factor authentication
History
Ability to disable OTP authenticator and WebAuthn devices individually or simultaneously
introduced
in GitLab 17.6.
You can disable the OTP authenticator and WebAuthn devices individually or simultaneously. To disable them simultaneously:
Access your
User settings
.
Select
Account
.
Select
Manage two-factor authentication
.
In the
Disable two-factor authentication
section, select
Disable two-factor authentication
.
On the dialog, enter your current password and select
Disable two-factor authentication
.
This clears all your 2FA registrations, including mobile applications and WebAuthn devices.
Information for GitLab administrators
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
Take care that 2FA keeps working after
restoring a GitLab backup
.
To ensure 2FA authorizes correctly with an OTP server, synchronize your GitLab
server’s time using a service like NTP. Otherwise, authorization can always fail because of time differences.
The GitLab WebAuthn implementation does not work when the GitLab instance is accessed from multiple hostnames
or FQDNs. Each WebAuthn registration is linked to the current hostname at the time of registration, and
cannot be used for other hostnames or FQDNs.
For example, if a user is trying to access a GitLab instance from
first.host.xyz
and
second.host.xyz
:
The user signs in by using
first.host.xyz
and registers their WebAuthn key.
The user signs out and attempts to sign in by using
first.host.xyz
- WebAuthn authentication succeeds.
The user signs out and attempts to sign in by using
second.host.xyz
- WebAuthn authentication fails, because
the WebAuthn key has only been registered on
first.host.xyz
.
To enforce 2FA at the system or group levels see,
Enforce two-factor authentication
.
