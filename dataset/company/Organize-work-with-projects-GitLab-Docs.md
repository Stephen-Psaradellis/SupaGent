Organize work with projects
In GitLab, a project is a broad container for all aspects of your development work. Projects
contain a code repository, collaborative tools, project management features, and CI/CD capabilities.
Use your project to organize all the data for your development project:
Track issues
Plan work
Collaborate on code
Use CI/CD tools to continuously build, test, and deploy your application
