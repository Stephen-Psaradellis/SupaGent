Dental implants are a long-term solution to replacing missing teeth, supporting your existing oral structures, and giving you back your freedom to live your life on your terms. When choosing an oral surgeon, it is imperative that you choose someone you trust. At Printers Row Dental Studio, Dr. Ema is highly-trained and experienced and is committed to providing unparalleled patient care, placing the best dental implants Chicago has to offer.\nThere are a number of reasons why you may need implants. If youâre looking for a trusted Chicago dentist, youâve come to the right place. Dr. Ema understands that dental implant surgery can be a great source of anxiety for many people, and she is proud to offer in-office amenities and sedation to make your experience as comfortable and painless as possible.\nWhy Replacing Teeth is Important\nReplacing missing teeth is not a solely cosmetic concern. There are a number of side effects that you can experience if you donât close the gap left by missing teeth, including:\nChanges to the shape of your face\nMore susceptible to tooth decay and gum disease\nChanges to your bite because the surrounding teeth may start to shift\nIf youâre missing even one tooth, it is very important to explore your replacement option in order to preserve your long-term oral health.\nWhat are Dental Implants\nAll on 4 Before\nAll on 4 After\nImplants are posts that Dr. Ema surgically implants into your jawbone to act as a replacement for the root of your tooth. After the dental implant fuses to your jawbone, Dr. Ema will place a crown on top of the implant that will look and feel like a natural tooth.\nBy replacing a missing tooth with aÂ\ndental implant\n, Dr. Ema helps preserve your jawbone and, in turn, the overall structure of your face.Â One of the most effective and least invasive implants we offer at Printers Row Dental Studio is theÂ\nAll-On 4 treatment\nBenefits of Implants\nDental implants are designed to look, feel, and function like natural teeth\nSince the dental implant fuses with your bone, the discomfort of dentures is not a problem\nWith proper care, dental implants will last many years, and, in some cases, they can last the rest of your life\nDental Implants prevent further bone loss and help retain the shape and appearance of your face\nThey are permanent and stable\nNumber of Sessions\nDental implants are applied in three sessions on average. In the first session, a patientâs measurements are taken to create an implant that is perfectly matched to the patientâs jaw so that it fits well and will stay securely in place.\nDuring the next two appointments, multiple sections of the implant are installed. This process happens in separate sessions to make sure each piece of the implant is securely in place before the next piece is added on.\nWithout a session dedicated to measurement, any implant inserted into the jaw will not fit correctly, coming loose or feeling very painful when being used to bite or chew food.\nÂ Pausing in between treatments also allows the patients to heal before the next procedure so that there is no unnecessary damage done or pain caused.\nWhat Should I Expect?\nDental implant surgery includes the placement of the implants and the placement of the crowns over the implants. Dr. Ema will surgically place the posts into your jawbone, where it will fuse with the bone itself, supporting the surrounding bone structure. Once this process is complete, Dr. Ema will attach abutments to the posts. These abutments will hold your permanent crowns.\nTo learn more about the dental implants we offer, visit our\nÂ implants page on our Chicago Veneers site\nWe understand that surgery can be a frightening prospect for some, and at Printers Row Dental Studio, it is our goal to make your experience as stress-free as possible by providing you with our best care. We are here for anything you may need before, during, and after your surgery.
